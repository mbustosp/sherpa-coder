<summary>10. Enhance with File Attachments</summary>

Take advantage of the powerful file attachment feature:

- Attach files directly from your workspace
- Generate and attach a markdown file containing your entire workspace's source code
- Provide context-rich information to the AI assistant

You can also attach the full source code of the current workspace. For this we will create a markdown file containing your source code. We will omit the files from gitignore and binary files that you might have in your workspace.

### File Search Capability

To utilize the attachments feature effectively, ensure that your OpenAI assistants have the "search in files" feature activated in their assistant settings.
